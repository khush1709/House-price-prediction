# Multiple Linear Regression Project

This repository contains a Python implementation of a multiple linear regression model for predicting house prices using scikit-learn's `SGDRegressor`. The project includes data loading, preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and visualization.

## Overview

The goal of this project is to demonstrate the implementation of a multiple linear regression model using scikit-learn for predicting house prices based on various features. The code is written in Python and can be run in a Jupyter Notebook environment.

## Contents

- `multiple_linear_regression.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the code implementation.
- `data.csv`: Sample dataset with features and target variable for house prices.
- `lab_utils_multi.py`: Utility functions (not provided) for loading house data.
- `lab_utils_common.py`: Common utility functions (not provided).

## Dependencies

Make sure you have the following libraries installed:

```bash
pip install numpy matplotlib scikit-learn pandas
```

##  Usage
1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/multiple-linear-regression.git
cd multiple-linear-regression
```
1. Open and run the multiple_linear_regression.ipynb notebook in a Jupyter environment.
2. Customize the code based on your own dataset and requirements.

## Results
The model's performance metrics, such as R-squared and Mean Squared Error, are printed in the notebook.

## Acknowledgments
